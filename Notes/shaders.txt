In shaders, each vertex is a point, and the values between two points are automatically interpolated.
Fresnel Effect
shaders -> properties and sub shaders 
		sub shaders -> pass -> vertex shader(foreach vertex) and fragment(foreach fragment/pixel) shader
shaders vs material(material contains the color,values and textures which has a reference to a shader)
BarryCentric -> interpolation of 3 points of the triangle
swizling -> extracting component from a vector

Spaces in unity 
object/local space -> refers to the coordinate system relative the current gameObject origin. So changing the tranform/rotation of the object will affect the axis.
world space -> refers to the coordinate system relative to the global scene. 
clip space

lerping vs inverse lerping
TAU scales the output to the range (-1, 1) when the input is (0,1)
Blending

depth buffer (before painters algorithm was used) -> each pixel has a z-index value that represnts depth from camera
ZWrite Off -> diables writing into the depth buffer
ZTest Always -> doesnt read from the depth buffer

tesslation shader -> can subdivide traingles

Textures -> a texture is basically an image that gets mapped to the surface of an object rgt
Sampling textures in world space or based on uv coordinate;
